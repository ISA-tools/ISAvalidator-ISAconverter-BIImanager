"Study Title"	"Subtle metabolic and liver gene transcriptional changes underlie diet-induced fatty liver susceptibility in insulin-resistant mice"												
"Study Description"	"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Complex changes in gene expression are associated with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) promoted by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD). We used functional genomic technologies to document molecular mechanisms associated with diet-induced NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male 129S6 mice were fed a diet containing 40% fat (high-fat diet, HFD) for 15 weeks. Glucose tolerance, in vivo insulin secretion, plasma lipid profile and adiposity were determined. Plasma metabonomics and liver transcriptomics were used to identify changes in gene expression associated with HFD-induced NAFLD. RESULTS: In HFD-fed mice, NAFLD and impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis were associated with increased hepatic transcription of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, intracellular transport, modification and elongation, whilst genes involved in beta-oxidation and lipoprotein secretion were, paradoxically, also upregulated. NAFLD developed despite strong and sustained downregulation of transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1) and uncoordinated regulation of transcription of Scd1 and the gene encoding sterol regulatory element binding factor 1c (Srebf1c) transcription. Inflammatory mechanisms appeared to be stimulated by HFD. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide an accurate representation of subtle changes in metabolic and gene expression regulation underlying disease-promoting and compensatory mechanisms, collectively contributing to diet-induced insulin resistance and NAFLD. They suggest that proposed models of NAFLD pathogenesis can be enriched with novel diet-reactive genes and disease mechanisms."

"Study Protocol Description"	"Male mice from the 129S6/SvEv and BALB/c inbred strains were used. Mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age and housed in groups of ten. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light and dark cycle and fed ad libitum a standard carbohydrate (CD) chow (ERB, Witham, UK) from weaning. At 5 weeks of age, one group of mice was transferred to an HFD (Special Diets Services, Witham, UK), containing 32% lard oil and 8% corn oil. A separate age-matched group remained on the CD. All procedures were carried out in accordance with national license conditions."	"Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and cleaned with RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA oncentrations and integrity were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany)."	"cDNA synthesis and biotinlabelled cRNA synthesis was performed using 10 _g of total RNA from each liver sample. cRNA concentrations and integrity were assessed using an Agilent 2100"	"Gene transcription profiling was carried out using Affymetrix expression arrays U430A and B (Affymetrix UK, High Wycombe, UK), which contain 22,690 (U430A) and 22,576 (U430B) probe sets, allowing the interrogation of the transcription level of 13 250 (U430A) and 7577 (U430B) independent gene and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences.Biotinylated cRNAs were fragmented and individually hybridised in an Affymetrix oven to the arrays."	"Washing and staining procedures were performed in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. Arrays were scanned at 560 nm using an Agilent array scanner (Affymetrix UK)"	"CEL were normalized using Bioconductor packages implement RMA and quantile normalization"	"1H-NMR spectra of individual mice were acquired at 600.22 MHz on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer (Bruker, Coventry, UK) using a 100 _l plasma aliquot. Standard monodimensional spectra were acquired using a selective presaturation pulse sequence for water signal suppression as described elsewhere [16]. For each acquisition, 128 transient-free induction decays (FID) were collected into 32,768 data points using a spectral width of 20 ppm. The FIDs were convoluted with an exponential weighting function corresponding to a line broadening of 0.3 Hz before Fourier transform. The acquired NMR spectra were corrected for phase and baseline distortions using in-house software and referenced to glucose _-anomeric signal (_5.23) [16]. The 1H-NMR spectra were imported as full-spectrum data [17]. To remove the effects of variation in the suppression of the water resonance, the region (_4.5�5.0) was discarded. "		"The data were normalised using noise variance normalisation. The final data set was then mean-centred prior to analysis [17]."	"Plasma Immuno reactive Insulin was determined using an ELISA kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Plasma lipids were measured using colorimetric detection assays (ABX Diagnostics, Shefford, UK) on a COBAS MIRA clinical chemistry analyser (ABX Diagnostics)."

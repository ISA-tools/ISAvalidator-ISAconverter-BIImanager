Refer to manuscript for more information.	"SMART cDNA synthesis and amplification (Zhu et al., 2001) was followed by Duplex-Specific Nuclease (DSN) normalisation. 80ng of this normalised sample was subjected to a further round of amplification using the Advantage 2 Polymerase mix and 0.4 •À_•À__M SMART PCR primer (Clontech Laboratories, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting product was purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) to a final concentration of ~300 ng/ •À_•À__l prior to pyrosequencing sequencing. "	"At least 4 ug of normalised cDNA was submitted to the Advanced Genomics Facility (AGF) at The University of Liverpool where the sample was prepared using methods essentially as those described by Margulies et al., 2005:  sample quality was first assessed using the Agilent bioanalyser and then the sample was nebulised into 300-500 bp fragments, blunted and ligated to short adapters. Each fragment was then fixed to DNA capture beads (one fragment one bead) and subjected to emulsion PCR (emPCR).

"	All fragments were amplified in parallel and then placed into individual wells of a PicoTiterPlate where they were sequenced also in parallel using the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument (Roche).	"DSN normalisation is described in Zhulidov et al, 2004 and enriches for full length transcript sequences and equal transcript abundance."					Study Protocol URI			pmid:11314272			pmid:16056220	pmid:14973331					Study Protocol Version												Study Protocol Parameters Name				library name;library strategy;library source;library selection;library layout;target_gene	Library Name;Library Strategy;Library Source;Library Selection;Library Layout	sequencing instrument;library layout;Flow count						Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Accession Number												Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Source REF												Study Protocol Components Name						454 GS FLX;PHRED						Study Protocol Components Type				 		sequencer;base-caller software						Study Protocol Components Type Term Accession Number												Study Protocol Components Type Term Source REF												STUDY CONTACTS												Study Person Last Name	Paterson	Tiwari	Brandizi									Study Person First Name	Steve	Bela	Marco									Study Person Mid Initials												Study Person Email	s.paterson@liverpool.ac.uk		brandizi@ebi.ac.uk									Study Person Phone			+44 (0)1223 492 613									Study Person Fax												Study Person Address	"School of Biological Sciences Life Sciences Building, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7ZB"	"Mansfield Road Oxford, OX1 3SR"	"Hinxton, CB10 1SD, United Kingdom"									Study Person Affiliation	School of Biological Sciences 	NERC CEH Oxford	European Bioinformatics Institute									Study Person Roles	principle investigator	submitter	SRA Inform On Status;SRA Inform On Error									Study Person Roles Term Accession Number	35											Study Person Roles Term Source REF	sep

Study Title	"Salmonella Modulates Metabolism during Growth under Conditions that Induce Expression of Virulence Genes"
Study Description	"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a facultative pathogen that uses complex mechanisms to invade and proliferate within mammalian host cells. To investigate possible contributions of metabolic processes to virulence in S. Typhimurium grown under conditions known to induce expression of virulence genes, we used a metabolomics-driven systems biology approach coupled with genome scale modeling. First, we identified distinct metabolite profiles associated with bacteria grown in either rich or virulence-inducing media and report the most comprehensive coverage of the S. Typhimurium metabolome to date. Second, we applied an omics-informed genome scale modeling analysis of the functional consequences of adaptive alterations in S. Typhimurium metabolism during growth under our conditions. Modeling efforts highlighted a decreased cellular capability to both produce and utilize intracellular amino acids during stationary phase culture in virulence conditions, despite significant abundance increases for these molecules as observed by our metabolomics measurements. Furthermore, analysis of omics data in the context of the metabolic model indicated rewiring of the metabolic network to support pathways associated with virulence. For example, cellular concentrations of polyamines were perturbed, as well as the predicted capacity for secretion and uptake."

Study Protocol Description	"S. Typhimurium wild type cells (ATCC 14028) were used throughout this study and were taken from a single colony on an agar plate, subsequently inoculated into 7 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) media (comprised of 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% sodium chloride at pH 7), and incubated overnight at 37°C. The overnight culture was centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellets were suspended in LB media and centrifuged again, and the supernatant was discarded. For LB cultures, the cell pellets were subsequently suspended in 2 mL of LB media and used to inoculate 700 mL of LB in a 2.8 L flask. After 160 min of growth, cells were harvested via centrifugation (4,000×g) and washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (Mediatech) once cultures reached an OD600 of +1.0. To stimulate the Salmonella virulence program, cells were transferred to a low pH, low magnesium, and low iron (LPM) medium comprised of 8 µM MgCL2, 0.5 µM ferric citrate, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM NH4SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 0.3% glycerol v/v, 0.00001% thiamine, 337 µM H3PO4, and 80 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.8. Briefly, cell pellets from the 7 mL LB media were suspended in LPM media and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were suspended in 2 mL of LPM media and used to inoculate 700 mL of LPM in a 2.8 L flask. Cells were harvested after 4 h or 20 h, then washed and isolated as above. Three biological replicates were performed for each of the conditions described above."	"Cell pellets were stored at -80°C prior to thawing and were subsequently resuspended in an appropriate volume of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate according to their wet weight to compensate for any differences in cell numbers. The cells were lysed by bead-beating, and the lysates were transferred into new tubes. Subsequently, 100 µL aliquots of cell lysates were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20°C) chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the aqueous phases after centrifugation were transferred to glass vials and dried in vacuo (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All samples were kept at -80°C prior to chemical derivatization for GC-MS analysis."	"Chromatography was carried out on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (Chemstation) and a HP-5MS gas chromatography column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness)."	"Samples were analyzed in duplicate using an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). One microliter of each sample was injected in splitless mode and with the port temperature held at 250°C throughout analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60°C for 1 min and then ramped to 325°C by 10°C/min and kept at this final temperature for 5 min to complete an analysis cycle. Derivatized metabolites eluting from the GC column were ionized using electron ionization (70 eV), and data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m/z."	"After converting raw data to netCDF format, the data were processed by the MetaboliteDetector software for peak deconvolution and chromatographic alignment. Retention indices (RI) were calculated based on the analysis of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (C8 - C30) (Agilent Technologies) as external retention time standards, then their retention index information was subsequently applied to all experimental chromatograms for retention time alignment. MetaboliteDetector parameters for peak detection and deconvolution are as follows: Peak threshold, 7; minimum peak height, 7; deconvolution width, 8."	"Deconvoluted features were identified by matching to the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked Library, which contains mass spectral and retention index information for approximately 700 metabolites. Each initial match to the library was manually inspected to confirm a confident identification. MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; ΔRI, 25; minimum S/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses. All identifications were manually validated by inspection of retention index and spectrum matches."	"Dried metabolite extracts were briefly dried again to remove any residual water prior to chemical derivatization. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 µL of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/mL) were added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37°C with generous shaking for 90 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 µL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37°C with shaking for 30 min. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were then analyzed by GC-MS in random order. For technical replicates, each of the derivatized samples was split into two different vials and analyzed separately."
